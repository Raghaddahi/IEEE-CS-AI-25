## Descriptive
1.organize, summarize using graphs and numbers.
2.Data summary
3.Mean,mode and mode
4.Range, variance and standard deviation
## Inferential
1.using data to draw conclusion
2.determining how confident we can be that the conclusions are correct

##  Mean, Median, Mode, and Range
1.mean=$∑$values/number of values
2.median: if n is odd, the median is the middle number.
n is even, median is the average of the two middle numbers.
3.mode: most frequent value, if no number is repeated the data set has no mode, 
data set can has two modes or more.
4.Range=the highest num - lowest num.


### variance
It measures the spread between numbers in a data set.
sample variance:
![[variance.png]]
$xˉ$=mean
## standard deviation
The variance represents how much are the data spread apart around the mean.

## The Interquartile Range  
min(zero percentile), max(100th percentile).
q1 is the median of the lower half of the data: 25th percentile.
q2 is the median of the data: the 50th percentile
q3 is the median of the upper half of the data: 75th percentile.

IQR=Q3-Q1

## Outliers
the outliers is the numbers outside of:$[ 𝑄 1 − 1.5 ∗ 𝐼 𝑄 𝑅 , 𝑄 3 + 1.5 ∗ 𝐼 𝑄 𝑅 ]$
